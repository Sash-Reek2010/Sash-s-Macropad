# Sash's Macropad
Its a cool tiny keyboard meant to be used to play story based games! It also has an oled to display whatever you want!This is how it would look irl once its finished!

I think it kinda looks like a calculator but its still insanely cool!!

## Inspo
I really wanted a small macropad so that I could play story based games! I also wanted a cool screen to display random stuff! Plus lights!!!!

## Challenges
This is my first ever time making a pcb and also doing CAD. So it was hard at first but i got the hang of it soon enough! Im really proud of myself tbh :3 

## Features
It has four main keys for wasd and two more for the spacebar and e. It also has an OLED which is nice to have! And a bunch of neopixels for the fun! The outer case is 3d printed and it hosts the pcb inside really well! As for a special feature, holding the space key will translate to esc

## The CAD model
This is my first time designing a model so im really happy with how it turned out! <img width="1298" height="828" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-08 211244" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fd41e41-16e8-48b9-bd1e-d6bf54bf67f7" />
It has a tiny window for the XIAO RP2040 because it makes it look cooler! 

## The PCB
I made the PCB in Kicad and it was really fun to make :3<img width="684" height="573" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-09 065138" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b4bdac3-e20b-4aa8-9ed9-b723a6c8654f" />
